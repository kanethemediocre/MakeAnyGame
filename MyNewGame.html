//Barring special provisions, the X and Y position are measured in pixels from the top left corner of the canvas
//and the X and Y velocity are measured in pixels per frame.
//Negative velocity values cause movement in the opposite direction as positive values
//Decimal velocity values are allowed, and they will cause movement to be slower than 1 pixel per frame,
//so movement may not be visible on every frame.
//Negative position values and position values greater than canvas.width or canvas.height are off the screen.
//However, js will still draw any part of any graphics object that falls within the canvas.
//For example, a circle with a center at x = 200 and y = -40 will be partly visible if it's radius is larger than 40.
